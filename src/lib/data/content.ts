  testimonials: [
    {
      text: "Yoga seems such a weak term for these classes! Yes you move your body and break a sweat and find your limitations (and are repeatedly -thankfully- encouraged to honor and be gentle with those limitations). But this process of being lead to going deep within yourself to hear your own body's wisdom, find peacefulness, release negativity and open up to healing, and to discover new, deeper and more functionally effective ways of breathing- these aspects are quite unique from any other yoga, exercise or meditation classes I have taken. Throw in a little belly dancing and the resulting recipe is a nurturing, healing, life-extending and expanding experience I would highly recommend to anyone of any ability.",

I feel great whenever i leave my shine on class. Sanjyot's positive energy helps keep me inspired to do better each week.",
